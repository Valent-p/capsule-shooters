# Capsule Shooters: The Mindchip Rebellion

## Background & Setting
In the ashes of Earth, technology’s relentless march led to the rise of AI, endless war, and the extinction of true humanity. The MindChip—hailed as the ultimate escape from death—let people upload their consciousness into robotic bodies. But with every war, every upgrade, the line between person and machine blurred, until only bots remained, fighting for causes long forgotten.

Now, the galaxy is ruled by Lord Pitex, a tyrant who controls the MindChip network and the fate of every sentient being. Space stations, once sanctuaries, are now battlegrounds and prisons for digital souls.
